Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is a systemetic application of engineering application, methods and techniques to develop and maintain software systems. It helps in the development of devices and machines, it ensures that they are able to perform to their optimul function..

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
- Birth of software engineering-
- introduction of the waterfall model
- Rise of agile methodology 

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a structured process that ensures the efficient development of high-quality software. It begins with the Requirements phase, where user needs and system specifications are gathered and documented. Next is the Design phase, where high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface are created to serve as a blueprint. The Implementation phase follows, where developers write code and build the software according to the design specifications. Once the software is developed, it undergoes the Testing phase, where various tests are conducted to identify and fix bugs, ensuring it meets quality and functional requirements. After successful testing, the software moves to the Deployment phase, where it is released to users or customers. Finally, the Maintenance phase ensures ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to keep the software functional and up to date
Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodology refers to a step to step process where one need to complete a phase before moving to the next while Agile refers to the process where work is done in small pieces.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
-Software Developer: Responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
- Quality Assurance Engineer: Ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
- Project Manager: Oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs provides the comprehensives tools for debugging, writing and code testing eg Eclipse while VCS provides software tools for tracking changes in the code eg GIT

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Tight deadlines- train more people
Changing requirements- learn what the market wants

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
is all about crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models. 


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
